|Business Logic Testing|Test Name|Description|Tools|Status|Comment|
|----------------------|---------|-----------|-----|------|-------|
|OTG-BUSLOGIC-001|Business Logic Data Validation|Looking for data entry points or hand off points between systems or software, Once found try to insert logically invalid data into the application/system.|{{proxy}}|Not Started||
|OTG-BUSLOGIC-002|Ability to Forge Requests|Looking for guessable, predictable or hidden functionality of fields, Once found try to insert logically valid data into the application/system allowing the user go through the application/system against the normal busineess logic workflow.|{{proxy}}|Not Started||
|OTG-BUSLOGIC-003|Integrity Checks|Looking for parts of the application/system (components i.e. For example, input fields, databases or logs) that move, store or handle data/information, For each identified component determine what type of data/information is logically acceptable and what types the application/system should guard against. Also, consider who according to the business logic is allowed to insert, update and delete data/information and in each component, Attempt to insert, update or edit delete the data/information values with invalid data/information into each component (i.e. input, database, or log) by users that should not be allowed per the busines logic workflow.|{{proxy}}|Not Started||
|OTG-BUSLOGIC-004|Process Timing|Looking for application/system functionality that may be impacted by time. Such as execution time or actions that help users predict a future outcome or allow one to circumvent any part of the business logic or workflow. For example, not completing transactions in an expected time, Develop and execute the mis-use cases ensuring that attackers can not gain an advantage based on any timing.|{{proxy}}|Not Started||
|OTG-BUSLOGIC-005|Number of Times a Function Can be Used Limits|Looking for functions or features in the application or system that should not be executed more that a single time or specified number of times during the business logic workflow, For each of the functions and features found that should only be executed a single time or specified number of times during the business logic workflow, develop abuse/misuse cases that may allow a user to execute more than the allowable number of times.|{{proxy}}|Not Started||
|OTG-BUSLOGIC-006|Circumvention of Work Flows|Looking for methods to skip or go to steps in the application process in a different order from the designed/intended business logic flow, For each method develop a misuse case and try to circumvent or perform an action that is "not acceptable" per the the business logic workflow.|{{proxy}}|Not Started||
|OTG-BUSLOGIC-007|Defenses Against Application Mis-use|Measures that might indicate the application has in-built self-defense: Changed responses, Blocked requests, Actions that log a user out or lock their account|{{proxy}}|Not Started||
|OTG-BUSLOGIC-008|Upload of Unexpected File Types|Review the project documentation and perform some exploratory testing looking for file types that should be "unsupported" by the application/system, Try to upload these “unsupported” files an verify that it are properly rejected, If multiple files can be uploaded at once, there must be tests in place to verify that each file is properly evaluated, PS. file.phtml, shell.phPWND, SHELL~1.PHP|{{proxy}}|Not Started||
|OTG-BUSLOGIC-009|Upload of Malicious Files|Develop or acquire a known “malicious” file, Try to upload the malicious file to the application/system and verify that it is correctly rejected, If multiple files can be uploaded at once, there must be tests in place to verify that each file is properly evaluated.|{{proxy}}|Not Started||
