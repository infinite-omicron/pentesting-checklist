# Penetration Testing Checklist

_OWASP-based Web Application Security Testing Checklist._

## Motivation

Using a text-based format such as markdown for this checklist allows for easier manipulation via common UNIX commandline tools such as `awk`, `grep`, and `sed`.

## GitHub Issues Templates

Copy markdown file(s) to the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory, prepend the following YAML snippet to the front matter, and customize for each template:

```yaml
about: ~
assignees: ~
labels: ~
name: ~
title: ~
```
